# movieFinder

It uses Omdb-API to fetch data about the movie searched and displays it, I have implemented debouncing in the seach bar. It also shows all the currently trending movies the data for with is again fetched using the Omdb API. I made it to practice and implement async-JS and learn more on REST-APIs. Completed it over a weekend.
